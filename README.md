# AgriTech - USGS LIDAR Challenge
This project tries to build a python package for AgriTech. IN AgriTech, the interest is in how water flows through a maize farm field. This knowledge will help us improve our research on new agricultural products being tested on farms.

## Package Functionalities
- **Data Featching and loading** : Fetch spacialy bound LIDAR data from user input and return python dictionary contining all years of geopandas file 

- **Terrain Visualization** : Give option to show data as
  - 3D render plot or
  - Heat map

- **Data Transformation**
  - Topographic wetness index (TWI) - as an additional column returned with geopandas dataframe
  - Standardized grid - A python code that takes elevation points output from the USGS LIDAR tool and interpolates them to a grid.
